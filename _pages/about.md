Hello! I'm a fourth-year PhD student in the [Language Technologies Institute](https://lti.cs.cmu.edu/) at CMU, where I'm advised by [Graham Neubig](http://www.phontron.com/). Before coming to CMU, I did my undergrad at the University of Toronto. My CV is [here](assets/pdf/CV_2024.pdf). I've also interned with Meta AI in the summer of 2024, and was fortunate to work with Chenyan Xiong and Scott Wen-tau Yih. I have also visited the Lingo lab at MIT in the summer of 2023, and worked with Jacob Andreas there.

I'm interested in various topics in NLP and cognitive science, but I'm especially interested in how machine learning models can generalize flexibly from their training data. In order to understand and facilitate this ability, I study flexible language use (such as metaphor and analogies) as well as compositionality and non-compositionality. Besides this, I'm also interested in neuroscience and NLP for social good.

You can contact me at `emmy@cmu.edu` if you're interested in collaborating or just talking. I'm happy to give any advice as well, especially to people starting out in NLP.
