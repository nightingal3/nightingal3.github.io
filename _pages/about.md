Hello! I'm a third-year PhD student in the [Language Technologies Institute](https://lti.cs.cmu.edu/) at CMU, where I'm advised by [Graham Neubig](http://www.phontron.com/). Before coming to CMU, I did my undergrad at the University of Toronto. My CV is [here](assets/pdf/CV_2023.pdf).

I'm interested in various topics in NLP and cognitive science, but I'm especially interested in how machine learning models can generalize flexibly from their training data. In order to understand and facilitate this ability, I study flexible language use (such as metaphor and analogies) as well as compositionality and non-compositionality. Besides this, I'm also interested in neuroscience and NLP for social good.

You can contact me at `emmy@cmu.edu` if you're interested in collaborating or just talking. I'm happy to give any advice as well, especially to people starting out in NLP.
